Component Breakdown: Describe each major component/module from the source code:





Purpose of the component.



Key files or classes (e.g., main.py, UserController.java).



Interactions with other components.



Data Flow: Explain how data moves through the system (e.g., user input â†’ API â†’ database â†’ response).

3. Installation and Setup





Prerequisites: List hardware/software requirements (e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js, 8GB RAM).



Dependencies: Provide a list of external libraries or tools with versions (e.g., requirements.txt or package.json contents).



Installation Steps:





Step-by-step instructions to set up the environment (e.g., cloning the repository, installing dependencies).



Example commands:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
cd project
pip install -r requirements.txt



Configuration: Explain how to configure the project (e.g., environment variables, config files like .env).



Running the Project: Provide commands to start the application (e.g., npm start, python manage.py runserver).

4. Code Structure





Directory Layout: Describe the folder structure with a tree-like representation:

project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ views/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â””â”€â”€ README.md



Key Files and Modules:





List important files/modules from the source code.



Explain their purpose (e.g., auth.py handles user authentication).



Naming Conventions: Document coding standards used (e.g., camelCase, snake_case).



Code Organization: Explain how the codebase is organized (e.g., MVC pattern, modular design).

5. Functionality and Usage





Core Features: Provide detailed explanations of each feature, including:





Description of the feature.



How it works (refer to relevant source code functions/classes).



Example usage scenarios (e.g., "To create a user, send a POST request to /api/users").



User Interface (if applicable):





Describe the UI/UX design.



Include screenshots or references to UI code (e.g., HomePage.jsx).



APIs/Endpoints (if applicable):





List all API endpoints with:





HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).



URL path (e.g., /api/users/:id).



Request/response format (e.g., JSON schema).



Reference to source code (e.g., routes/users.js).



Usage Examples:





Provide sample inputs/outputs or workflows (e.g., command-line usage, API calls with curl).

6. Development Guidelines





Contributing: Explain how to contribute to the project (e.g., fork, branch, pull request process).



Coding Standards:





Formatting rules (e.g., use Prettier, 2-space indentation).



Documentation requirements (e.g., docstrings for all functions).



Version Control:





Branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, feature branches).



Commit message conventions (e.g., "feat: add user login endpoint").



Build and Deployment:





Instructions for building the project (e.g., npm run build).



Deployment steps (e.g., deploying to AWS, Heroku).

7. Testing





Test Strategy: Describe the types of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end).



Test Setup: Explain how to run tests (e.g., pytest, npm test).



Test Coverage: Provide details on coverage (e.g., "80% coverage, see coverage/ folder").



Key Test Files:





List important test files from the source code (e.g., tests/test_auth.py).



Explain what they test.



Sample Test Cases:





Provide examples of test cases and their purpose.

8. Maintenance and Troubleshooting





Logging and Monitoring:





Describe logging mechanisms (e.g., logs written to app.log).



Monitoring tools (if any, e.g., Prometheus).



Common Issues and Solutions:





List known issues and fixes (e.g., "Database connection error: check .env credentials").



Updating the Project:





Instructions for updating dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade).



Migration steps for database or schema changes.



Backup and Recovery:





Procedures for backing up data and recovering the system.

9. Security Considerations





Authentication/Authorization:





Explain security mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth, implemented in auth middleware).



Data Protection:
